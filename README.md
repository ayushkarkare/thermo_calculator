The web application was never hosted due to hosting fees but the MATLAB app is available for use. I will warn that this version is very buggy and slow as I just developed it and many improvements can be made. 
For a demonstration of both the web app and the MATLAB app see this video: https://youtu.be/7WOmO2sJrZM

To use the MATLAB version all you have to do is download and open the .mlappinstall file in MATLAB and open the app using the App taskbar
